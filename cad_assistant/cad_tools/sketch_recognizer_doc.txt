def sketch_recognizer(sketch: Sketch) -> None:
    """Analyzes a 2D CAD sketch, providing both a JSON serialization of the Attributes for the geometry 
    and constraints and an image rendering of the sketch. Use this function to understand the current FreeCAD sketch.

    This function processes the given sketch and returns a JSON representation describing its geometric 
    elements (e.g., lines, arcs, points, circles) and constraints from the `sketch.Geometry` 
    and `sketch.Constraints` lists. Attributes for Geometries and constraints are extracted directly from these lists, 
    serialized into a structured JSON format for easy interpretation. 
    
    Additionally, this function generates an image rendering of the sketch for visual examination. The sketch
    is rendered as a black and white image. Primitives of the CAD sketch are labeled with a unique numerical ID,
    shown by a marker that is positioned over the primitive.
    
    Parameters:
    ----------
    sketch (Sketch): 
        The input sketch object to be analyzed, containing the geometries and constraints.
            
    Prints:
    -------
    Displays the sketch's parameters and constraints for quick review. It also returns a
    sketch_image (PIL.Image.Image or np.ndarray) rendering of the sketch.

    Usage Example:
    --------------
    >>> sketch_recognizer(sketch)
    The sketch contains the following geometries and constraints, serialized in JSON format:
    {
        "Geometry": [
            {
                "Index": 1,
                "Type": "Line segment",
                "StartPoint": {
                    "x": ...,
                    "y": ...
                },
                "EndPoint": {
                    "x": ...,
                    "y": ...
                },
                "isConstruction": ...
        ],
        "Constraints": [
            { ... }
        ]
    }
    Rendered image of the sketch:
