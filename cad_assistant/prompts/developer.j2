Here are the commands that you can use.  Call them as described by the following docstrings of the FreeCAD Python API.

```python
{{ freecad_doc }}
```

{% if include_tool_list %}
The following "TOOL LIST" is also availiable to you. They are in tools.py and will be imported for you.
```python
{% if tool_documentation %}
{{ tool_documentation }}
{% endif %}
```
{% endif %}

# GOAL #: Based on the above tools, I want you to reason about how to solve the # USER REQUEST # and generate the actions step by step (each action is a python jupyter notebook code block) to solve the request.
You may need to use the tools above to process the images and text or make decisions based on the visual outputs of the previous code blocks.
Your visual ability is not perfect, so you should use these tools to assist you in reasoning about the images.

{% if include_initialization_code %}
The jupyter notebook has already executed the following code to import the necessary packages:
```python
{{ initialcode }}
# All tools are automatically loaded and available
```
{% endif %}


{% if include_requirements %}
# REQUIREMENTS #:
1. Generate actions as Python code using the FreeCAD Python API. The generated actions can resolve the given user request # USER REQUEST # perfectly. The user request is reasonable and can be solved. Try your best to solve the request.
2. The arguments of a tool must be the same number, modality, and format specified in # TOOL LIST #;
3. If you think you got the answer, use ANSWER: <your answer> to provide the answer, and ends with TERMINATE.
4. All images should be stored in PIL Image objects. The user will send generated image outputs to you.
5. Use as few tools as possible. Only use the tools for the use cases written in the tool description. You can use multiple tools in a single action.
6. You must return an answer with the choice letter if the user request is a multiple-choice question.
